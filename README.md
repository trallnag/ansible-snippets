# My Ansible Snippets

My (more or less) personal snippets to make life with Ansible easier. Mostly
I'm storing here various roles that represent certain services or functions that
I use on different hosts. Many of them are not generic and may contain stuff
like personal domain names or directory structures and workflows I prefer. But
of course no secret data.

## Ubuntu Server 20.04

| [**Network-Manager**](ubuntu-server-20.04/roles/networkmanager) | No | Removes network-manager |
